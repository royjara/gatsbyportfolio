## The motivation behind this website 

Hi Jerry,

Sorry for taking longer than what I initially said.

These are the instructions to get this site up and running:

**0. Brief overview of websites, and this one in particular:** <br>

They're made with three types of files: <br>
-- HTML (barebones structure of the website.) <br>
-- CSS ("Styles". Defines font families, colors, etc) <br>
-- JS (adds extra functionality to website) <br>

Stack of technologies in this specific project: <br>
-- React ("frontend" framework which lets you make components that combine js with html and css) <br>
-- Gatsby.js ("static site generator" - simplifies development and publishing of react projects) <br>
-- Node (Backend technology, let's react and gatsby run and do their thing)


**1. Things to downoad and install:**<br>
-- https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/<br>
-- vs code https://code.visualstudio.com/ (where you will code/edit code)<br>
-- 

**2. Copy example project from github**<br>
-- Open vscode <br>
-- open a terminal console <br>
<img src="../images/open_terminal.PNG"></img>
-- enter > mkdir "name of a folder where you want to copy project files"<br>
*mkdir is short for make directory*
<img src="../images/enteringcommandinterminal.PNG"></img>
-- enter > cd testfolder
*cd is short for change directory*
-- enter > git clone https://github.com/royjara/gatsbyportfolio.git <br>


**3. Use node to install every other thing that's needed to run project**<br>
-- enter > cd gatsbyportfolio <br>
-- once inside the project directory, you run > npm install <br>
*npm stands for node package manager. react, gatsby and all these extra things are node packages.* <br>
-- install gatsby-cli (command line interface) by running > npm install -g gatsby-cli <br>
*the "-" indicates this is an optional argument for the npm install command* <br>
*-g is global, so that gatsby-cli is installed in the entire computer, not just within this folder* <br>


## cheers
