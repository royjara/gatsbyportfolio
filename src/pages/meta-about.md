## The motivation behind this website 

Hello internet, world, friends and family.

So, the last couple of years my personal work output has been extremely limited.
I have started several projects, thought of even more project ideas, but looking back, there is nothing tangible to demonstrate that I haven't been lazy. More importantly, after all the explorations (touch, coding, audio, engineering, design, even life), I don't have notes on my thought process or mere rough sketches to not make the same mistakes and further develop my ideas.

Therefore, I am making this website! 

Apart from serving as a way to demonstrate I can do frontend development (and experiment with web technologies), I am going to document the struggle of thinking of ideas that are beyond my skill level. Luckily, this is how one grows, improves, and eventually, becomes a pro.

I'm still pursuing the dream of becoming a creative technologist. <br>
This will be the journal that accompanies me towards achieving that goal.
