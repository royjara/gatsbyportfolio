My one true love, TouchDesigner, is a computer program that can be anything. You can script it, you can work it by hand, you can input many possible audio, video and data sources, and also output just as many. <br>
Artists use it to make installations, some people make software with it, others (such as deadmau5) use it for their shows. They support python, c++, have components to handle I/O from ableton. You can do projection mapping, audio reactive generative graphics, use it for HCI projects, the possibilities are endless.
